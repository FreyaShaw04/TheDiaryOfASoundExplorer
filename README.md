# TheDiaryOfASoundExplorer
Listen to the sonic diary entries written by Leo, an eccentric sound recordist who has taken time out of working in his hat and instrument shop to record the world. This game is explored through exclusively audio so is accessible to both visually impaired and sighted players. Enjoy!
